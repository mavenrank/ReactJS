        <h1>Learn how to make Grilled Cheese Sandwich</h1>
        <h2>Grilled Cheese Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            This classic grilled cheese sandwich recipe calls for just white
            bread, sliced cheese, and butter. It's easy to switch up the bread
            and cheese to suit your taste preferences and, if you like, you can
            substitute mayonnaise for butter.
        </p>
        <h2>Best Cheese for Grilled Cheese</h2>
        <p>
            This recipe calls for sliced Cheddar, which is a wonderfully
            crowd-pleasing cheese. You can use sharp Cheddar, mild Cheddar, or a
            blend of both. Another classic choice is plain ol' sliced American
            cheese - it tastes nostalgic and gives you a gorgeous cheese pull.
        </p>
        <h2>Best Bread for Grilled Cheese</h2>
        <p>
            This recipe calls for plain white sandwich bread. You could also use
            sourdough, brioche, or even ciabatta. You can really make grilled
            cheese with any type of bread you like, but you should make sure the
            loaf is sturdy enough to handle the heat. Thinly sliced, delicate
            breads will quickly fall apart.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>4 slices white bread</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
                <li>2 slices Cheddar cheese</li>

                <p>
                Preheat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Generously butter one
                side of a slice of bread. Place bread butter-side down in the hot
                skillet; add 1 slice of cheese. Butter a second slice of bread on
                one side and place butter-side up on top of cheese.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Cook until lightly browned on one side; flip over and continue
                    cooking until cheese is melted. Repeat with remaining 2 slices of
                    bread, butter, and slice of cheese.
